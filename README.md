The loan eligibility prediction system effectively uses a Logistic Regression model to determine if a loan should be approved based on input features. The system preprocesses data, trains a model, and provides predictions based on user input. The accuracy score of the model gives an indication of its performance. By following this approach, you can assess loan eligibility efficiently and offer real-time predictions to users.
